# AdvidSite

A simple, static website designed for showcasing [Advid]. Built with HTML and CSS, this website serves as a promotional platform with responsive design and clean, minimalist UI. I would like to say that I did everything from scratch, but that would not be true as this design is loosely based off one of the templates from www.free-css.com (*I swear it isnt a direct ripoff*)
